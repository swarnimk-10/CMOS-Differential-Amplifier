## CMOS Differential Amplifier Design using Cadence Virtuoso
A differential amplifier is an analog electronic circuit that amplifies the voltage difference between two input signals while rejecting any voltage common to both. It is a fundamental building block in analog circuit design and widely used in systems like operational amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and sensors.
I have used a PMOS current mirror in this design.

## Simulation Results

- **Technology**: GPDK 90nm CMOS  
- **Differential Gain**: 29.54 dB (Ratio of differential output to input (in dB): 20*log10(Vo/Vi)) 
- **Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)**: ~60 dB  (Ability to reject common input signals: CMRR = 20*log10(Ad/Acm))
- **Slew Rate**: ~1.5 V/Âµs (estimated)  (Maximum rate of change of output voltage with time: SR = dV/dt)
- **Output Voltage Swing**: 0.996 V to 1.0345 V (~38.5 mV peak-to-peak)  (Output voltage range without distortion)
- **Supply Voltage (VDD)**: 1.2 V
